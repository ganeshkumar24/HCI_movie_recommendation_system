## Simple Recommendation System using python

We will develop basic recommendation systems using Python and pandas.

In this notebook, we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item.
We can then use corrwith() method to get correlations between two pandas series. If we sort the dataframe by correlation, we should get the most similar movies.
